// PS5 port (vk-285-135, AI-assisted): games on NFS shares. Testers asked for "nfs mounting":
// playing games straight off a PC or NAS share, without copying them to a drive.
//
// A share is an nfs:// address in gs.ini's PS5SX2/NfsShares (the settings page, or the shelf's
// folder picker), several separated by ';' or new lines:
//   nfs://192.168.1.10/volume1/PS2                NFS v3 through the server's portmapper (Linux,
//   Synology, QNAP, TrueNAS,
//                                                 WinNFSd, haneWIN), else NFS v4 on port 2049
//   nfs://192.168.1.10/srv/games?version=4        NFS v4 only
//   nfs://pc/PS2?nfsport=2049&mountport=1058      fixed ports (no portmapper); also uid=, gid= (who
//   the server sees)
// The share's files appear under /nfs/<host>/<path> (/nfs/192.168.1.10/volume1/PS2/...), and
// main-boot.cpp adds that folder to the game folders, so the shelf lists its games as it lists a
// drive's. The folder may be inside what the server exports (it mounts the longest part of the path
// it allows).
//
// The console's kernel has no NFS client, so the app is its own (libnfs, ps5/third_party/libnfs):
// link-vk.sh passes the C library's file calls through this file (ld.lld --wrap: fopen, fread,
// fseeko, ..., open, read, pread, lseek, fstat, close, stat, lstat, access, realpath; dirshim.cpp's
// opendir/readdir/closedir ask it too). A /nfs/ path goes to the server; every other path, and
// every FILE or descriptor that isn't one of its own, goes to the real call unchanged. Read-only:
// writing on a share fails with EROFS.
